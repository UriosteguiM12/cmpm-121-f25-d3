# CMPM 121 D3 Project

This is a browser-based, tile-based game built with Leaflet.js. Players explore a grid of coin caches, collecting and upgrading coins by matching values. Caches within 30 meters appear blue, while out-of-range caches turn gray. Click on a cache to pick up a coin if you’re not holding one, or upgrade your coin by matching its value. The goal is to reach a coin value of 256. The game uses modular helper functions, clear constants for configuration, and tooltips to show cache values.
