# D3: Game Title TBD (Coin Collector/Merge?)

## Game Design Vision

In this game, the goal is for the user to trade coins until they reach a value of 256. In order to collect coins, the user must travel across the world and find a place where the respective coin needed spawns and only collect it once they are close enough. The user is able to see the value of each coin before travelling to it.

## Technologies

- Typescript for most game code, little to no explicit HTML, and all CSS collected in common 'style.css' file
- Deno and Vite for building
- Github Actions + Github Pages for deployment automation
